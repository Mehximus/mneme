# OpenCode harness

OpenCode has no hook JSON. It loads project plugins from `.opencode/plugins/*.js` when it starts in that directory, so the installer writes one managed file, `.opencode/plugins/mneme-v3.js`, from `template/.claude/scripts/mneme_v3_opencode.py`. There is no link or enable step: open OpenCode in the vault. Rollback and uninstall remove the plugin like every other managed file.

The plugin derives the vault from its own location and the runtime directory from `.mneme-runtime.json`. Only the interpreter is pinned at install time; `MNEME_PYTHON` overrides it. Every event runs `mneme_v3_hook.py --harness opencode` with a 6 second bound (20 seconds on Windows). A missing interpreter, timeout, non-zero exit or invalid output returns no context and never fails the OpenCode turn. A vault without a valid runtime file registers no hooks.

## Supported versions

One plugin file serves both plugin APIs. OpenCode 2.x reads the default export `{ id: "mneme-v3", setup }`; OpenCode 1.x from 1.3.4 on reads `server` from the same default export, which is the `MnemeV3` factory that is also exported by name. Releases before 1.3.4 call every export as a function and report a load error for the default object; update OpenCode instead of editing the managed plugin, because `mneme.py update` stops on a changed managed file.

## Lifecycle mapping (OpenCode 1.x)

The first `chat.message` of a session is `SessionStart`; later ones are `UserPromptSubmit` with the non-synthetic text parts as `prompt`. `session.idle` is `Stop`, `session.deleted` is `SessionEnd`, `experimental.session.compacting` is `PreCompact`, and `tool.execute.after` for edit, write and patch tools is `PostToolUse`.

`experimental.chat.system.transform` is the only request-time injection channel. The `SessionStart` context is sent with every request of that session and the latest `UserPromptSubmit` context with its own turn, which matches what Claude keeps in its transcript. The adapter returns the Claude and Codex `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` shape for `opencode`; retrieval output is byte-equal to Claude for the same query.

## Lifecycle mapping (OpenCode 2.x)

`setup(ctx)` registers the same events on the context: the first `ctx.session.hook("prompt")` of a session is `SessionStart`, later ones are `UserPromptSubmit` with `prompt.text`; `ctx.session.hook("context")` pushes the same contexts as `{ type: "text", text }` system parts; `ctx.tool.hook("execute.after")` for the same write tools is `PostToolUse` unless the call failed; `ctx.session.hook("compaction")` is `PreCompact`. `ctx.event.subscribe` delivers `session.execution.succeeded`, `failed` or `interrupted` at the end of a turn (2.0.18 no longer emits `session.idle`); the first of these after a prompt is `Stop`, so each prompted turn gets exactly one. The session id is `event.data.sessionID`.

OpenCode 2.x loads plugins in the background service (`opencode serve --service`), which keeps running after the TUI or `opencode run` exits, so there is no client-exit moment. `SessionEnd` is sent once per session, on `session.deleted` or from the cleanup `setup` returns, which runs when the service stops (`opencode service stop`, SIGTERM) or reloads the plugin. A killed service sends no `SessionEnd`; `Stop` still covers every turn.

Sub-agent sessions (`parentID` set, for example the `task` tool on 1.x or `subagent` on 2.x; 2.x reads it with `ctx.session.get({ sessionID })`) are ignored. They never submit receipts, so their checkpoints would only report false receipt gaps. Agents running in OpenCode submit receipts with `--harness opencode`.

## Validation boundary

`tests/v3_opencode_test.py` installs a synthetic vault, imports the generated plugin in Node with a fake OpenCode 1.x client and a fake 2.x `setup` context, and drives every mapped hook and event; the Node cases skip when `node` is absent. One real OpenCode 1.18.25 session in a temporary synthetic vault returned a canary fact from injected context with tool use prohibited by the prompt, and the queue acknowledged `SessionStart` and `Stop` with no hook error. For #133 the same plugin ran in real OpenCode 1.17.18 and 2.0.18 sessions in temporary synthetic vaults against a local mock OpenAI-compatible model: 1.17.18 queued the same events and injected the same system context as the previous plugin, and 2.0.18 reached `observed_metadata` for all six events in `mneme.py doctor`, with the context in the model request and none in a sub-agent request. This does not establish OpenCode Desktop or web delivery.
