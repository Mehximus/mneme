# Real client checks, 16 September 2026

These checks launch the installed clients against a temporary, synthetic vault. They do not read the operator's real notes or copy account settings into the repository. Raw CLI output remains in private temporary files. [Sanitized machine evidence](evidence/live-clients.json).

## Final product workflows

Real Claude Sonnet and Codex Sol sessions used the mneme skill from the three installed starter skills, plus the shared CLI to create an active task with its source-backed owner, store a CSV decision note and submit a receipt. Source fields and preserved notes were checked after execution. Antigravity Sonnet completed the same artifact workflow interactively, with normal command permission prompts; its receipt was completed in a follow-up session after the first time bound. [Product evidence](evidence/product-live-clients.json).

Two failed attempts matter: Claude initially nested task frontmatter inside note-create. A dedicated task-create command, exact skill recipe and six regression cases fixed that; fresh Claude and Codex trials passed. Headless Antigravity returned SUCCESS while denying writes, so that attempt is recorded as failed. Inspect denied_actions and resulting files, not only the process exit code. Its generated prose also added inferred scope; these narrow tests validate requested fields and are not a general semantic-accuracy guarantee.

**Codex Desktop uses the same runtime and skills.** Actual app-host execution retrieved a newly edited source marker, created the correct active task and stored a Codex receipt. However, automatic hook context was not delivered in this app-host test, even after normal project trust review and a cold reload. A normal CLI control delivered its marker. The installed context command now refreshes sources directly and refuses conflict/degraded results, so the skill workflow works without that automatic delivery. Do not describe this as verified Desktop hook parity. [Desktop workflow evidence](evidence/desktop-workflow.json).

The following original canaries used earlier installed bytes; their hashes and narrow scope remain historical evidence. Native CI is reported separately.

## What was exercised

1. Install the shared runtime into the temporary vault and index a synthetic fact. Add a private-visibility sentinel which must be absent from injected context.
2. Start a new client process. Ask for the fact using only injected context, with file/tool reading prohibited by the prompt (Claude additionally has tools disabled). Compare the final answer with the expected value; process exit 0 alone is insufficient.
3. Invoke a synthetic skill whose expected response exists only in its `SKILL.md`. Codex reads `.agents/skills`; Claude reads its linked `.claude/skills` entry.
4. Change an already indexed source without increasing its declared frontmatter revision. Start a new session and check that the hook refreshes the answer to the new source value.

These are narrow end-to-end canaries. They do not measure general model accuracy or prevent an independently authorized agent from reading a private file with other tools. Visibility filtering governs this runtime's injected context.

## Results

| Client | Injected fact | Shared skill | Source edit, new session |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | Exact match, trusted project hooks | Exact match | Updated value returned |
| Claude Code | Exact match | Exact match | Updated value returned |
| Antigravity | Exact match, explicit workspace | Exact match on second attempt | Covered by shared offline sync tests; no separate live edit test |

All final responses passed the synthetic private-sentinel check. Antigravity's first skill response contained the correct marker plus prose, failing strict equality; a second prompt explicitly requesting only the skill response passed. Both outcomes are retained in the evidence. No expected value was included in the model prompts.

## Client launch details

Claude Code **2.1.271**, model `sonnet`: `claude -p PROMPT --model sonnet --setting-sources project,local --strict-mcp-config --mcp-config '{"mcpServers":{}}' --tools '' --output-format json`. Skill checks allow `Read,Skill` and use `/mneme-smoke`. Project/local settings load the installed lifecycle definitions. `--bare` is unsuitable because it skips hooks and subscription authentication.

Codex CLI **0.153.3**, model `gpt-5.6-sol`, low reasoning, read-only sandbox: use a dedicated test CODEX_HOME with access to existing local authentication, trust the synthetic folder interactively, and review the installed definitions using `/hooks`. Then run `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -C VAULT -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort='"low"' --sandbox read-only --json PROMPT`. The successful project-discovery run uses no hook trust bypass and no inline hook substitution. A preliminary `--ignore-user-config` run omitted project hooks; it is not counted as installation proof. A separate invocation-only bypass diagnosis passed but is superseded by the trusted run.

Antigravity, model `claude-sonnet-4-6`: trust the synthetic folder, then use `agy --add-dir VAULT --mode plan --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --sandbox --output-format json --print-timeout 90s -p PROMPT`. **Headless mode requires explicit workspace attachment with `--add-dir`; changing shell cwd alone did not load workspace hooks.** The installed `.agents/hooks.json` definitions produce actual `SessionStart` and `Stop` queue acknowledgements.

For all CLI automation, close stdin explicitly and capture raw output privately. Parse the client's final response field, not a search across logs or echoed prompts. These commands are validation recipes, not daemon launchers.

## Failure-driven improvements

- Real Claude startup exposed a missing-context bug for ordinary facts without task status. A regression failed before the fix; startup snapshots now include eligible statusless notes/facts and still exclude completed tasks and unknown-status tasks.
- Antigravity workspace attachment was corrected in the headless recipe; its adapter schema did not require a speculative change.
- Windows redirected output was checked under a non-UTF-8 encoding. The failure led to portable JSON output and a regression. Native Windows CI subsequently passed; see the separate platform evidence.

## Boundaries

Real client checks here run on macOS. Offline Linux containers exercise source, queue, skills and installer behavior. Native platform CI and the Desktop app-host workflow are covered by separate evidence above; these older CLI results do not establish either. Compaction and actual client crashes were not forced in paid model sessions; corresponding adapter/queue contracts have synthetic failure-injection tests.

Official contracts: [Codex hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks) and [Claude hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Antigravity's installed CLI help, changelog and runtime observations supplied its workspace behavior.
