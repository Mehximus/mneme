# Hermes Agent harness

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is the fourth supported client
after Codex, Claude Code and Antigravity. It has no project-local hook file; it loads plugins from
`~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/` and calls `register(ctx)` once at startup. V3 therefore ships the
implementation inside the vault and lets the installer plan a two-file shim that the user links
into that directory once.

## What the installer writes

| File | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/scripts/mneme_v3_hermes.py` | managed | Hook implementation; runs `mneme_v3_hook.py --harness hermes` as a bounded subprocess |
| `.claude/hermes-plugin/__init__.py` | managed | Shim that pins this machine's vault path and imports the module above |
| `.claude/hermes-plugin/plugin.yaml` | managed | Hermes plugin manifest (`pre_llm_call`, `on_session_finalize`) |

All three roll back with `mneme.py rollback` / `--uninstall` like every other managed file.

## Linking the plugin (one time per machine)

Hermes loads user plugins only after they are explicitly enabled, so linking alone is not
enough. `HERMES_HOME` must be the profile of the Hermes process you actually run
(`~/.hermes` by default on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on native Windows; a named
profile needs `hermes -p PROFILE` for the enable step).

```sh
HERMES_HOME="${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}"
VAULT="/absolute/path/to/vault"
mkdir -p "$HERMES_HOME/plugins"
ln -s "$VAULT/.claude/hermes-plugin" "$HERMES_HOME/plugins/mneme-v3"
hermes plugins enable mneme-v3
hermes plugins list        # mneme-v3 must show "enabled"
```

```powershell
$hermesHome = if ($env:HERMES_HOME) { $env:HERMES_HOME } else { Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'hermes' }
$vault = 'C:\absolute\path\to\vault'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Join-Path $hermesHome 'plugins') | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path (Join-Path $hermesHome 'plugins\mneme-v3') -Target (Join-Path $vault '.claude\hermes-plugin')
hermes plugins enable mneme-v3
hermes plugins list
```

Then restart the Hermes process that uses this profile (`hermes serve`, the gateway or the
CLI). `MNEME_VAULT` in that process' environment overrides the pinned path, which is what a
shared plugin directory on a multi-vault machine would use. The installer never touches
`HERMES_HOME`; linking, enabling and removing the link on uninstall are operator steps.

## Event mapping

| Hermes hook | V3 event | Context returned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre_llm_call` with `is_first_turn=True` | `SessionStart` | companion continuity + ranked context |
| `pre_llm_call` afterwards | `UserPromptSubmit` (`prompt` = user message) | ranked context for that turn, companion when the query asks for it |
| `on_session_finalize` | `SessionEnd` | none; queues the checkpoint for receipt-gap tracking |

`pre_llm_call` returning `{"context": text}` is the only Hermes channel that injects text into a
turn; the plugin uses nothing else. `on_session_end` is a *turn* outcome in Hermes, not a chat
close, so it is deliberately not bound.

### Unattended sessions

Hermes passes `platform` to `pre_llm_call`. Sessions on platforms nobody sits in front of
(`cron`, `telegram`, `discord`, `slack`, `whatsapp`, `signal`, `matrix`, `email`, `sms`,
`webhook`; see `UNATTENDED_PLATFORMS`) still receive context, but their finalize does **not**
queue `SessionEnd`. Those sessions never submit receipts, so counting them as checkpoints would
make every later interactive start warn about "missing receipts". The platform is remembered
from the first turn because Hermes reports a generic value at finalize. Unknown or absent
platforms are tracked normally.

### Receipt reminder

Every `REMINDER_EVERY` (15) user turns of an interactive session the plugin appends a one-line
`[Hafıza]` reminder to write a receipt — the same cadence the V2 Hermes adapter used. It is
plain text inside the injected context, not an instruction the adapter enforces.

Retrieval semantics are identical to the other harnesses (`tests/v3_hermes_test.py` asserts the
Claude and Hermes outputs for the same query are byte-equal). Preferences (`mneme.py preferences`)
apply unchanged: `context_mode`, `context_chars`, `interval_minutes` and `auto_sync` all govern the
Hermes turns too.

## Failure behaviour

The subprocess waits at most `HOOK_TIMEOUT` (6 s POSIX / 20 s Windows, inside Hermes' default
30 s hook budget). Two failure classes are reported in two places:

- Failures the adapter handles itself (sync conflicts, degraded sources, invalid payloads) are
  written to the adapter's `hook-error.json` and surfaced by `mneme.py doctor`.
- Transport failures (interpreter missing, timeout, non-zero exit, unparsable stdout) happen
  before or outside the adapter, so they cannot reach `hook-error.json`. They return no context
  for that turn and are logged as warnings through Hermes' plugin logger (`mneme_v3_hermes`),
  without the prompt, payload or child output.

A vault without `.mneme-runtime.json` registers no hooks at all so Hermes stays usable when the
vault is unmounted. A damaged runtime file (invalid JSON, missing or relative `state`) also
registers nothing and logs the exception class only; fix the file and restart to re-enable.

Hook metadata files carry the event name, harness and a hashed session id, never the prompt.

## Receipts

Agents running inside Hermes submit receipts with `--harness hermes`; `doctor` lists `hermes`
under `lifecycle`. The `mneme` skill's receipt step already says "choose the current client", so no
skill text changes were needed beyond naming the fourth option.

## Not covered

This adapter does not map compaction or tool-completion events. Hermes exposes `post_tool_call`,
but selective write-tool mapping is outside this change's scope. Prompts longer than the
adapter's 1 000 000-character stdin limit are rejected by the adapter itself (logged in
`hook-error.json`) and produce no queue event; Hermes turns are far below that.

The unittest suite drives the installed shim and the hook mapping with a fake plugin context;
it does not establish live model or remote Desktop delivery. Sanitized operator `doctor`
output for a real Hermes profile is attached to the pull request separately and is not part
of the synthetic CI canaries.
